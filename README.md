# CSN150 Lab: ESP32-NAT_Router_LC
## Objective: Create an ESP32 Router using our inexpensive ESP32CAM.
### Equipment:
1.

### Steps Followed:
1. I downloaded the zip file from documentation 1 and unzipped the file.
2. I downloaded the zip file from documentation 2 under "Flash Download Tools" (Windows PC V3.9.5 for my machine) and unzipped the file.
3. Run the Flash Download Tool from step 2 that's inside the folder.
4. Following Documentation 3 and 4 (similar information), select ChipType "ESP32" and WorkMode as "Develop".
5. Load the bootloader from documentation 1 folder under "esp32_nat_router-master" and under "build" > "esp32" > you see 3 .bin files; "bootloader.bin", "firmware.bin", "partitions.bin".
6.  Load the "firmware.bin".
7.  Load the "partitions.bin".
8.  Type the correct hex location numbers; "bootloader.bin" = 0x1000, "firmware.bin" = 0x10000, "partitions.bin" = 0x8000.
9.  Plug in the ESP32 (ensure your drivers are correct if this is your first time using esp32) and identify which port your esp32 is plugged into. Select the port on the bottom right and set BAUD rate to 115200.
10.  Start the flash tool (you may need to put esp32 in flashing mode, refer to documentation 3-4).
11.  Now unplug and plug in your esp32 to reset.
12.  On your PC's internet settings, you should see the esp32 appear shortly (disconnect from any ethernet connections at this time). Connect to the esp32.
13.  Connect into the esp32 by opening your browser and typing "192.168.4.1"
14.  Configure your esp32 router accordingly based on your prefrences as described by documentation 3-4.

### Problems Encoutered:
1. This one was difficult and time consuming to discover, but it turned out something had happened to my esp32 driver in COM4 at some point. Somehow, my 2014 CH341 version driver had disconnected itself requiring me to manually select the 2014 driver in device manager because, somehow, all drivers since 2015 somehow aren't working for everyone. The errors I would get didn't do a very good job of letting me know a physical connection was the problem and online resources regarding the issue was all over the place.

Solution: Double check your drivers every time. Run a basic Arduino IDE Program to ensure your physical connection is operational and isn't going to be a problem at BAUD rate 115200.
